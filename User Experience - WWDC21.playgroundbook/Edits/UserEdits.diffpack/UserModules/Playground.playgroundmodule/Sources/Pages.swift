The preview on the left is going to be fully interactive. \n\nTap the 'Run app' button and try to create a profile there - you will notice many usability issues, especially in the case of unexpected input. We will improve the UX step by step with some explanation and key lessons to take away. This first version is intentionally designed to be poorly usable, so you can experience how bad usability feels.",
