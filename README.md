## About ✌🏻
The Playground focuses on three important aspects of designing a good user experience. It provides an interactive simulated app on the left side and explanations on the right side. The simulated app features a terrible usability in the beginning and gets improved step by step with some key lessons to take away.

## Technology   🖥
The Playground was entirely build in SwiftUI and optimized for running on iPad.
