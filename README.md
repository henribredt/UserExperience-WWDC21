## About ‚úåüèª
The Playground focuses on three important aspects of designing a good user experience. It provides an interactive simulated app on the left side and explanations on the right side. The simulated app features a terrible usability in the beginning and gets improved step by step with some key lessons to take away.

## Technology and installation  üñ•
The Playground was entirely build in SwiftUI and optimized for running on iPad. Download the Swift Playgrounds App from the App Store and open this playground. Make sure to turn off 'Enable Results'.
