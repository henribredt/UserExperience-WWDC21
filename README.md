## About
The Playground explains three important aspects of designing a good user experience. It provides an interactive simulated app on the left side and explanations on the right side. The simulated app featues a terrible usability on the first page and gets improved step by step. 
The Playground was entirely build in SwiftUI and optimized for running on iPad.
